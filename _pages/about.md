My name is Daniel Anadria and I am an upcoming PhD candidate at Utrecht University's Department of Methodology and Statistics / Public Values in the Algorithmic Society Consortium (AlgoSoc).

I have a background in psychology, methodology, statistics for behavioral, biomedical, and social sciences, and applied data science with a strong focus on natural language processing. My upcoming research will concern fairness of algorithmic decision-making in healthcare.


<!-- I am a rising statistician and a data scientist in the final year 
of [MSc Methodology and Statistics](https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/methodology-and-statistics/master-msbbss){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} 
at [Utrecht University](https://uu.nl/en){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.  -->
<!-- My primary project is the development of a new feature attribution technique for transformer language models such as BERT 
which can be used to explain which words, phrases and sentences are driving their predictions.
I am always curious and in awe about something.
This is reflected in my side projects which I greatly enjoy:
- Collaboration on an article about best practices in latent class analysis using free open source software
- Collaboration on the implementation of state-of-the-art feature selection methods for the R package `mice` (Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations) -->
