I am a rising statistician and data scientist in the final year 
of [MSc Methodology and Statistics](https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/methodology-and-statistics/master-msbbss) at [Utrecht University](https://uu.nl/en).
I am always curious and in awe about something.
To me, there is nothing more exciting than discovering 
how the world works.
That is why I love learning and doing research.
