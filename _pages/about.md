I am a rising statistician and data scientist in the final year 
of [MSc Methodology and Statistics](https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/methodology-and-statistics/master-msbbss){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} 
at [Utrecht University](https://uu.nl/en){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. 
My primary project is the development of a new feature attribution technique for BERT 
which can be used to explain which words, phrases and sentences are driving its predictions.
I am always curious and in awe about something.
This is reflected in my side projects which I greatly enjoy:
- Collaborating on an article about best practices in latent class analysis using free open source software
- Collaborating on a meta-analysis about the use of active learning for systematic reviews
- Collaborating on the implementation of novel feature selection techniques for the R package `mice`
