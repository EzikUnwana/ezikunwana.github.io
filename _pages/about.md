Hi! üëã 
======

My name is Unwana Friday Ezekiel, I am a rising process engineer in the final year of Msc. Chemical Engineering at Politecnico Di Milan. 




<!-- I am a rising statistician and a data scientist in the final year 
of [MSc Methodology and Statistics](https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/methodology-and-statistics/master-msbbss){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} 
at [Utrecht University](https://uu.nl/en){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.  -->
<!-- My primary project is the development of a new feature attribution technique for transformer language models such as BERT 
which can be used to explain which words, phrases and sentences are driving their predictions.
I am always curious and in awe about something.
This is reflected in my side projects which I greatly enjoy:
- Collaboration on an article about best practices in latent class analysis using free open source software
- Collaboration on the implementation of state-of-the-art feature selection methods for the R package `mice` (Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations) -->


My interests involve:

- Green Technology 
- Process Optimization
- Fluid Dynamics
- Process Design
- Sustainable Chemical Plant Management
- PFD and P&ID


I am a affiliated with:

- [Laboratory of Catalysis and Catalytic Processes](https://www.lccp.polimi.it/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
- [Luca Lietti's Lab](https://www4.ceda.polimi.it/manifesti/manifesti/controller/ricerche/RicercaPerDocentiPublic.do?evn_didattica=evento&k_doc=90963&aa=2009&lang=IT&jaf_currentWFID=main/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}


What's new?
======
- Will be a TA in [Data Science: Introduction to Text Mining with R](https://utrechtsummerschool.nl/courses/social-sciences/data-science-introduction-to-text-mining-with-r) and [Data Science: Applied Text Mining](https://utrechtsummerschool.nl/courses/social-sciences/data-science-applied-text-mining)
- Joined the European Workshop for Algorithmic Fairness ([EWAF'23](https://sites.google.com/view/ewaf23/)) as a proceedings chair! ü™ë
- Defended MSc Thesis! üéâ
