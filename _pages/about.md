Welcome! üëã 
======

My name is Unwana Friday Ezekiel, I am a rising process engineer in the final year of [MSc Chemical Engineering](https://www.ccs-chimica.polimi.it/?lang=en){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}  at [Politecnico Di Milan](https://www.polimi.it/en){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. My love and fervour for chemical engineering emerged from the drive to be part of a team of engineers whom are seeking to make a sustainable future a reality. 


I am passionate about green technology. My research explores the cutting-edge opportunity to repurpose carbon dioxide, one of the main drivers of global warming, to a clean fuel source that could power our societies. I work as a member of the Laboratory of Catalysis and Catalytic Processes and [Maire Tecnimont](https://www.tecnimont.it/en){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} under the guidance of¬†Prof. Dr. Luca Lietti.




My interests involve:

- Green Technology 
- Process Optimization
- Fluid Dynamics
- Process Design
- Sustainable Chemical Plant Management
- PFD and P&ID


I am a affiliated with:

- [Laboratory of Catalysis and Catalytic Processes](https://www.lccp.polimi.it/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
