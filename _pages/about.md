I am a rising statistician and a data scientist in the final year 
of [MSc Methodology and Statistics](https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/methodology-and-statistics/master-msbbss){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} 
at [Utrecht University](https://uu.nl/en){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. 
My primary project is the development of a new feature attribution technique for transformer language models such as BERT 
which can be used to explain which words, phrases and sentences are driving their predictions.
I am always curious and in awe about something.
This is reflected in my side projects which I greatly enjoy:
- Collaboration on an article about best practices in latent class analysis using free open source software
- Collaboration on a systematic review about the use of active learning for systematic reviews
- Collaboration on the implementation of state-of-the-art feature selection methods for the R package `mice` 





Interests:
======
- NLP & Text-Mining
- Algorithmic Fairness & Explainable AI (XAI)
- Feature Attribution & Feature Selection
